# Pomodoro-beast
A python tool for estimating how much time it will take you to complete a task, based on your estimates. 

Over 2 million people have used Pomodoros or other time estimates when trying to schedule their day or month. When commiting to the pomodoro method, many people don't realize that getting rid of distractions and doing focused work is only one part of the process. Another huge part that many people miss is keeping track of how long it takes them to complete tasks, this helps with two things:

1. estimating pomodoros when completing a similar task in the future.
2. streamlining your process if a certain task is taking much longer than expected.

After using pomodoro for about 6 months, I realized that I was grossly under-estimating how long a certain task would take me, this was setting me back on my calendar and making me push important things into backlog. In order to solve this issue, I wrote a program that takes in all the data from my past pomodoros and uses that to predict if there is an underlying pattern to my underestimation and then seeks to correct it by offering me better predictions when planning out my calendar.
